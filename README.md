**Visualizing Generalized Canonical Discriminant and Canonical Correlation Analysis**

Version 0.8-6

This package includes functions for computing and visualizing 
generalized canonical discriminant analyses 
and canonical correlation analysis
for a multivariate linear model.  The goal is to provide ways of visualizing
such models in a low-dimensional space corresponding to dimensions
(linear combinations of the response variables) of maximal relationship
to the predictor variables. 

Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way MANOVA
design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
The `candisc` package generalizes this to multi-way MANOVA designs
for all terms in a multivariate linear model (i.e., an `mlm` object),
computing canonical scores and vectors for each term (giving a `"candiscList"` object).

The graphic functions are designed to provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations of
terms in a `mlm` via the `plot.candisc` method, 
and the HE plot `heplot.candisc()` and `heplot3d.candisc()`
methods.
For `mlm`s with more than a few response variables, these methods often provide a 
much simpler interpretation of the nature of effects in canonical space than
heplots for pairs of responses or an HE plot matrix of all responses in variable space.

Analogously, a multivariate linear (regression) model with quantitative predictors can also be
represented in a reduced-rank space by means of a canonical correlation
transformation of the Y and X variables to uncorrelated canonical variates,
Ycan and Xcan.  Computation for this analysis is provided by `cancor`
and related methods.  Visualization of these results in canonical space
are provided by the `plot.cancor()`,  `heplot.cancor()` 
and `heplot3d.cancor()` methods.

These relations among response variables in linear models can also be
useful for "effect ordering"
(Friendly & Kwan (2003)
for *variables* in other multivariate data displays to make the
displayed relationships more coherent.  The function `varOrder()`
implements a collection of these methods.
