**Visualizing Generalized Canonical Discriminant and Canonical Correlation Analysis**

Version 1.1.0

<!-- when in Rmd format, can use
Version `r getNamespaceVersion("candisc")`
-->

## Description 

This package includes functions for computing and visualizing 
generalized canonical discriminant analyses 
and canonical correlation analysis
for a multivariate linear model (MLM).  The goal is to provide ways of visualizing
such models in a low-dimensional space corresponding to dimensions
(linear combinations of the response variables) of maximal relationship
to the predictor variables. 

Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way MANOVA
design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
The `candisc` package generalizes this to multi-way MANOVA designs
for all terms in a multivariate linear model (i.e., an `mlm` object),
computing canonical scores and vectors for each term (giving a `"candiscList"` object).

For `mlm`s with more than a few response variables, these methods often provide a 
much simpler interpretation of the nature of effects in low-D _canonical space_ than
heplots for pairs of responses or an HE plot matrix of all responses in _variable space_.

The `candisc` package originated as a low-D cousin of the 
[heplots package](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/index.html), designed to 
provide visualization methods in low-dimensional space.

### Visualization methods

The graphic functions are designed to provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations of
terms in a `"mlm"` via the `plot.candisc()` method, which plots the observations
in _canonical space_, together with **variable vectors** showing the relations of the 
response `y` variables to the canonical variables `Can1`, `Can2`. This is the same idea
as that of a **biplot** (Gabriel, 1971).

The HE plot `heplot.candisc()` and `heplot3d.candisc()` methods use a similar framework,
but replace the observations and groupwise data ellipses in the plot with 
representations of the **H** ellipsoid, representing between-group variation
in the means and the **E** ellipsoid reflecting the pooled within-group variation.

Analogously, a multivariate linear (regression) model with quantitative predictors can also be
represented in a reduced-rank space by means of a canonical correlation
transformation of the Y and X variables to _uncorrelated_ **canonical variates**, named with the prefix
`Ycan` and `Xcan`.  Computation for this analysis is provided by `cancor()`
and related methods.  Visualization of these results in canonical space
are provided by the `plot.cancor()`,  `heplot.cancor()` 
and `heplot3d.cancor()` methods.

### Variable ordering

The relations among response variables in linear models can also be
useful for "effect ordering"
(Friendly & Kwan (2003))
for *variables* in other multivariate data displays, such as heatmaps or "corrgrams" (Friendly, 2002) of correlations.
to make the
displayed relationships more coherent.  The function `varOrder()`
implements a collection of these methods.

### Discriminant analysis

Some of these visualization methods have now been extended to linear and quadratic discriminant analysis,
using `MASS:lda()` or `MASS:qda()`.

* Provides a simplified interface to prediction, in `predict_discrim()`.
* A new plotting method, `plot_discrim()`, provides `ggplot2` plots of the classification regions and decision boundaries in data space and in discriminant space.
* `cor_lda()` calculates correlations between the observed variables and the discriminant dimensions.


## Installation

The current official release of the `candisc` package can be installed from CRAN. The most recent
development version can be installed from R-universe or this Github repo.

## Vignettes

* A new vignette, `vignette("diabetes", package="candisc")`, illustrates some of the methods of this package, with a dataset
on forms of diabetes.

* Another vignette, `vignette("painters", package="candisc")`, applies these methods to a dataset on the aesthetic ratings of classical
painters.

* A more comprehensive collection of examples, illustrating multivariate regression and MANOVA methods, is contained in the vignettes for the `heplots` package. Use `browseVignettes(package = "heplots")` to see them all.

## Examples

These examples will get you started.

### Iris data
Using the `iris` data, fit the multivariate model for `Species`. You can feed this to `candisc()` to get the 
canonical discriminant equivalent.

```{r iris-candisc}
iris.mod <- lm(cbind(Petal.Length, Sepal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Width) ~ Species, data=iris)
car::Anova(iris.mod)

iris.can <- candisc(iris.mod, data=iris)
iris.can
```

This says that although there are 4 dimensions in the `iris` data, only two are needed to fully account for the differences
among the group means relative to within-group variation. Both are significant by the likelihood ratio tests, but the first accounts for 99.1% of these
differences.

Methods are available to extract coefficients (`coef()`) and scores of observations on the canonical dimensions
(`scores()`).

```{r iris-coef}
# get coefficients
coef(iris.can)

scores(iris.can) |> str()
```

Correlations between the observed variables and the canonical dimensions are given by the `$structure` component of the
object.

```{r}
iris.can$structure
```


### Plotting methods

The basic plot for a `"candisc"` object is a scatterplot of the `scores()name` for the observations on the canonical variates,
which are the linear combinations of the observed variables. For ease of interpretation, it plots vectors
for the responses in the model showing their structure correlations with the canonical dimension.

The following plot illustrates some of the options.

```{r iris-canplot}
#-- assign colors and symbols corresponding to species
iris.colors <- c("red", "darkgreen", "blue")
iris.pch <- 15:17
plot(
  iris.can, 
  col = iris.colors,
  pch = iris.pch,
  ellipse = TRUE,
  var.lwd = 2,
  cex.lab = 1.4)
```


The `heplot()` method for a "candisc" object replaces the individual scores by a **H** ellipse showing variation of the
means and an **E** ellipse reflecting the pooled within-group variation.

```{r iris-heplot}
heplot(
  iris.can,
  fill = TRUE, fill.alpha = 0.1,
  prefix = "Canonical dimension",
  var.col = "black",
  var.lwd = 2,
  scale = 35,
  lab.cex = 1.25)
```
