\title{
Visualizing Generalized Canonical Discriminant and Canonical Correlation Analysis
}
\description{
This package includes functions for computing and visualizing 
generalized canonical discriminant analyses 
and canonical correlation analysis
for a multivariate linear model.  The goal is to provide ways of visualizing
such models in a low-dimensional space corresponding to dimensions
(linear combinations of the response variables) of maximal relationship
to the predictor variables. 

Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way MANOVA
design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
The \code{candisc} package generalizes this to multi-way MANOVA designs
for all terms in a multivariate linear model (i.e., an \code{mlm} object),
computing canonical scores and vectors for each term (giving a \code{candiscList} object).

The graphic functions are designed to provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations of
terms in a \code{mlm} via the \code{\link{plot.candisc}} method, 
and the HE plot \code{\link{heplot.candisc}} and \code{\link{heplot3d.candisc}}
methods.
For \code{mlm}s with more than a few response variables, these methods often provide a 
much simpler interpretation of the nature of effects in canonical space than
heplots for pairs of responses or an HE plot matrix of all responses in variable space.

Analogously, a multivariate linear (regression) model with quantitative predictors can also be
represented in a reduced-rank space by means of a canonical correlation
transformation of the Y and X variables to uncorrelated canonical variates,
Ycan and Xcan.  Computation for this analysis is provided by \code{\link{cancor}}
and related methods.  Visualization of these results in canonical space
are provided by the \code{\link{plot.cancor}},  \code{\link{heplot.cancor}} 
and \code{\link{heplot3d.cancor}} methods.

These relations among response variables in linear models can also be
useful for \dQuote{effect ordering}
(Friendly & Kwan (2003)
for \emph{variables} in other multivariate data displays to make the
displayed relationships more coherent.  The function \code{\link{varOrder}}
implements a collection of these methods.

A new vignette, \code{vignette("diabetes", package="candisc")},
illustrates some of these methods.
A more comprehensive collection of examples is contained in the vignette for the \pkg{heplots} package,

\code{vignette("HE-examples", package="heplots")}.
