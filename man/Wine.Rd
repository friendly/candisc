\title{Chemical composition of three cultivars of wine}
\format{

\item{\code{Cultivar}}{a factor with levels \code{barolo} \code{grignolino} \code{barbera}} 
\item{\code{Alcohol}}{a numeric vector}
\item{\code{MalicAcid}}{a numeric vector} 
\item{\code{Ash}}{a numeric vector} 
\item{\code{AlcAsh}}{a numeric vector, Alkalinity of ash}
\item{\code{Mg}}{a numeric vector, Magnesium} 
\item{\code{Phenols}}{a numeric vector, Total phenols} 
\item{\code{Flav}}{a numeric vector, Flavanoids} 
\item{\code{NonFlavPhenols}}{a numeric vector}

This data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
\code{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine}. This page references a
large number of papers that use this data set to compare different methods.
}
\description{
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same
region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.  The analysis
determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three
types of wines.
}
\details{
This data set is a classic in the machine learning literature as an easy
high-D classification problem, but is also of interest for examples of
MANOVA and discriminant analysis.

The precise definitions of these variables is unknown: units, how they were
measured, etc.
