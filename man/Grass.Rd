\description{
The data frame \code{Grass} gives the yield (10 * log10 dry-weight (g)) of
eight grass Species in five replicates (Block) grown in sand culture at five
levels of nitrogen.
}
\details{
Nitrogen (NaNO3) levels were chosen to vary from what was expected to be
from critically low to almost toxic.  The amount of Nitrogen can be
considered on a log3 scale, with levels 0, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Gittins (1985, Ch.
11) treats these as equally spaced for the purpose of testing polynomial
trends in Nitrogen level.

The data are also not truly multivariate, but rather a split-plot
experimental design.  For the purpose of exposition, he regards Species as
the experimental unit, so that correlations among the responses refer to a
composite representative of a species rather than to an individual exemplar.
