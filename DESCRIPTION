Description: This package includes functions for computing and visualizing 
	generalized canonical discriminant analyses for a multivariate linear model.
	Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way MANOVA
	design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
	response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
	The candisc package generalizes this to multi-way MANOVA designs
	for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
	computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) 
	visualizations of terms in an mlm via the plot.candisc and heplot.candisc methods.
